# Premium Features in Airbnb Listings

## Background
- Airbnb is a vacation rental online marketplace
- It's mission is to help create a world where you can belong anywhere and where people can live in a place, instead of just traveling to it.
- Hosts are able to set their own prices with the help from Airnb algorithms

    This study is to investigate and evaluate how the hosts are leveraging different features of a renting property to set the prices. In other words, what features of a property is important to the hosts and what do they deem valueable when considering a property as a rental property? More importantly, how can we identify the features the hosts used to justify a higher price point? In this study, we will define such features as **premium features**.   
  
    The dataset used to tackle this question is from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html),a website created by Murray Cox. This study will use datasets of NYC collected on August 19th 2019 and apply machine learing techniques to identify premium features.
